# The Lion Inn Website
## www.lioninn.co.uk

## Overview

This repository contains all the files used for developing the main WordPress version for The Lion Inn website.  

The alpha version (the lion-inn-alpha repository) was made as an MVP.  The goal was to get it released before Christmas so that a more up-to-date menu was available for customers.

The next stage was to create a WordPress version of the site so that it was editable by the owner of the pub.  That is this repository.  

The Lion Inn is a pub in Trellech, Monmoutshire, Wales.
