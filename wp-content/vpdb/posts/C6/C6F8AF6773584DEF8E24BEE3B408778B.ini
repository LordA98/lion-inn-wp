Built in the late 16th Century, actually completed in 1580, The Lion Inn was originally a coaching inn, brew house and pig farm. Many of the original features of the brewing cellar still remain, as do a number of outhouses that were used as pig sty's.

The Lion Inn is the only traditional inn in the ancient village of Trellech. It consists of two rooms, both with open fires and exposed wooden beams. One room is used as a traditional village bar, the other as a restaurant area.

The pub stocks a fine range of real ales and ciders, as well as the traditional range of keg Lager, Bitters, Ciders, Guiness and Spirits including a large range of whiskies, Gins and Rums.

The whole emphasis of the pub is towards the traditional - Traditional Beers, Real Ciders, Quality Home Made Food and a Friendly atmosphere."
